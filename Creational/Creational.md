# What are Creational Design Patterns?

Creational Design Patterns are ways of abstracting the instantiation process. (They hide the details about how objects and classes are created). Class creational patters use inheritance, whereas object creational patterns will use other objects to create a new object. As software projects evolve, there is a shift from class inheritance to object creation. 

There are two common themes in these patters:
- They encapsulate (bundle) what concrete classes are used
- Hide (abstract) how instances of concrete classes are "put together"

This means that there is a large amount of flexability in choosing *what* gets created, *who* creates it, *how* it gets created, and *when* it is created.
