# Design-Patterns

Design Patterns are ways of solving reoccurring problems in Object Oriented Programming. There are three categories of Design Patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. In this repository, I am creating my own custom implementation of Design Patterns based on my understanding of "Design Patterns" by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides. 

## Creational
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton
## Structural
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
## Behavioral
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
